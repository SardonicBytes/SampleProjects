# SampleProjects
Examples of some of my past work

//Destruction Game//

In this project I handled all gameplay logic and art, 
while the other partner built a custom importer for 
magicavoxel files, the destruction system, and the custom shaders.

Due to NDA, I can't share much else from this project, 
though since the vast majority of my work in this is on art, 
there is little of value to share

//Chess Game//

A current (though paused) project where you play wizards chess.
See https://github.com/SardonicBytes/2019-BattleMage for more details

//Formation Game//

This game was a Total War inspired game, with intent 
to mix with the idea of Hero generals with special 
abilities such as in League Of Legends, Overwatch, 
and Team Fortress 2.  This is a spiritual precursor 
to my current chess game.

The formations in this game went through various 
reworks, due to the different approaches having 
different pros and cons.  Ultimately, this project 
relied on AI that was beyond my time budget to complete,
as it relied on AI that had to be extremely optimized 
to run at real-time, and good enough to beat players 
in high level strategy.


//Action RPG//

This was an action RPG project which initially was prototyped 
using Unity's 3D Game Kit.  Many features were added such as: 
swimming 
-Use of shields
-Bow+Arrow
-Lunging attack 
-Dodge/Rolls
-Knockups and status effects
-Basic procedural dungeon generation (Rule-Based)
-Ledge Grabbing & Shimmying 
	(not completed due to it slowing down gameplay)
However, because of its origin in a project I did not make, 
I do not want to present scripts without context, for 
fear of taking credit for work that is not my own.
