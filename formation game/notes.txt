This game was a Total War inspired game, with intent 
to mix with the idea of Hero generals with special 
abilities such as in League Of Legends, Overwatch, 
and Team Fortress 2.  This is a spiritual precursor 
to my current chess game.

The formations in this game went through various 
reworks, due to the different approaches having 
different pros and cons.  Ultimately, this project 
relied on AI that was beyond my time budget to complete,
as it relied on AI that had to be extremely optimized 
to run at real-time, and good enough to beat players 
in high level strategy.
