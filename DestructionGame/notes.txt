In this project I handled all gameplay logic and art, 
while the other partner built a custom importer for 
magicavoxel files, the destruction system, and the custom shaders.

Due to NDA, I can't share anything else from this project, 
though since the vast majority of my work in this is on art, 
there is little of value to share
