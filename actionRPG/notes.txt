This was an action RPG project which initially was prototyped 
using Unity's 3D Game Kit.  Many features were added such as: 
swimming 
-Use of shields
-Bow+Arrow
-Lunging attack 
-Dodge/Rolls
-Knockups and status effects
-Basic procedural dungeon generation (Rule-Based)
-Ledge Grabbing & Shimmying 
	(not completed due to it slowing down gameplay)
However, because of its basis in a project I did not make, 
I do not want to present scripts without context, for 
fear of taking credit for work that is not my own.
