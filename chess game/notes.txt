This is a recently started Wizards Chess game.  

The player will, when complete, connect to their friends or bots to
play chess in an open environment, rather than an 8x8 grid, with 
slightly modified peice rules.  The wizards will be able to 
cast their spells to modify the playing field or alter the rules 
of the game.

Currently completed is: 
A basic login + registration screen, with
server hosting and quickjoin options, connected to SQL with PHP.
This will be the matchmaking method, while gamelogic will be P2P 
using Mirror.  Additionally, general movement ability of the player, 
generic object and peice pickup + movement, a grid system which 
will be expanded to hold game states. Object avoidance steering 
for the player (to be slightly modified for AI Agents once 
implemented) to avoid getting stuck on the many peices. 
basic highlighting set up for the grid overlay.

ToDo:
-Chess logic, checking for legal moves,
-Integrate Mirror
-Tie in to Steam's API for playing with friends.
-Complete matchmaking server and host on website.
-spell system and spells
-AI engine inspired by traditional min/max logic
-Utility AI for the wizard bots.  
-Machine Learning to optimize the AI within the given parameters.
